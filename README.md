## Features
### Design
One of the main features of the app is the design.
Its goal it to make the app intuitive and comfortable.

### In Call Interface
Our ongoing call UI makes everything easier.
It uses swipes and minimalistic design, making everything more beautiful, intuitive, yet still productive.

In an incoming call, you can do the following before answering:
* Reject and send the caller an SMS
* Reject in a specified amount of seconds
* Answer in a specified amount of seconds

In an ongoing call you can:
* Hang-up in a specified amount of seconds

### Swipes
The app's main goal is to be more intuitive and comfortable. For that reason, the swipes are the main way of controlling the app, making it much smoother to use.
  <!-- * ### Dialer
    * __Call__            - Swipe up  
    * __Delete number__   - Swipe left  
    * __Collapse dialer__ - Swipe on the contacts list  -->
  * ### Incoming Call
    * __Open keypad__     - Swipe up   
    * __Reject/End__      - Swipe left  
    * __Answer__          - Swipe right 
    * __Send sms__        - Swipe up on the send SMS overlay

### Call Actions
In Koler you can interact with incoming calls in new ways
  * ### Timer action
  You can answer and decline using a timer which you can modify in the settings
  * ### Sms decline

### Excel Page
Another great feature in Koler is the ability to import and manage calls using an excel file
