## Features
### Design
One of the main features of the app is the design.
Its goal it to make the app intuitive and comfortable.

### In Call Interface
Our ongoing call UI makes everything easier.
It uses swipes and minimalistic design, making everything more beautiful, intuitive, yet still productive.

In an incoming call, you can do the following before answering:
* Reject and send the caller an SMS
* Reject in a specified amount of seconds
* Answer in a specified amount of seconds

In an ongoing call you can:
* Hang-up in a specified amount of seconds

To use those features simply long click the answer or decline buttons for the appropriate action

### Swipes
The app's main goal is to be more intuitive and comfortable. For that reason, we tried to add more swipes into the app's functionality
    * ### Call screen features
       * __Open keypad__     - Swipe up   
       * __Reject/End__      - Swipe left  
       * __Answer__          - Swipe right 
       * __Send sms__        - Swipe up on the send SMS overlay

### Call Actions
In Koler you can interact with incoming calls in new ways
  * ### Timer action
  You can answer and decline using a timer which you can modify in the settings
  * ### Sms decline
  Decling the call while sending an SMS

### Excel Page
Another great feature in Koler is the ability to import and manage calls using an excel file
Koler offers a comfortable and simple UI for managing and editing a list of contacts
The Excel feature also offers the ability to call the list of imported contacts one by one
Great for people who call a lot of people one by one
